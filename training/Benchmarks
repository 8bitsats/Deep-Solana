Dynamic constraint generation with DeepSolanaZKr-1 slashes 68% of the manual effort typically required to design and tune ZK circuits, paving the way for orders-of-magnitude performance gains:

Average Proof Time drops from 2.4 s on vanilla Solana to 0.3 s—an 88% decrease in end-to-end proof latency.

Verification Throughput surges from 12 K TPS to 28 K TPS, more than doubling the rate at which proofs can be confirmed on-chain.

Privacy Overhead plunges from 0.07 SOL per proof to just 0.002 SOL, reducing the per-transaction cost of confidentiality by 97%.

State Accuracy, which was not tracked on baseline, now achieves 94.2%—ensuring that AI-guided proofs faithfully reflect on-chain state.

Energy Efficiency sees a 63% reduction in energy per proof versus standard Groth16, validated on 8 Bit’s FPGA cluster.

Together, these benchmarks illustrate how DeepSolanaZKr-1 transforms recursive ZK on Solana from a niche cryptographic experiment into a production-grade engine for private, intelligent, and sustainable blockchain applications.
